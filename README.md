🏥 Kyphosis Risk Classification (2023) – R

This project aims to predict the risk of kyphosis in children using machine learning models.
The study compares Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to determine the most effective classification approach.

📌 Methodology:

Feature selection and preprocessing
Model training and comparison (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, SVM)
Performance evaluation using ROC curves and classification metrics
🔍 Technologies Used: R, caret, e1071, rpart, ggplot2

🚀 Open for contributions and improvements!
